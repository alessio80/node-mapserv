# Node Mapserv on Windows

Although Windows is not currently an officially supported platform for Node
Mapserv, the module has been successfully built on Windows.  The related GitHub
issues ([#7](https://github.com/geo-data/node-mapserv/issues/7) and
[#14](https://github.com/geo-data/node-mapserv/issues/14)) provide further
details on building with Windows.

## Installation

It would be nice to simplify the Windows build process to enable a simple `npm
install mapserv` (in a similar manner to the Linux build) but for now it is a
manual process along the following lines:

1. Ensure you have an appropriate version of Node and `node-gyp` installed.

2. [Download](https://github.com/geo-data/node-mapserv/tags) and unpack Node
   Mapserv.  Take note of where the `binding.gyp` file is.

3. Download the appropriate Mapserver SDK from the
   [GDAL and MapServer build SDK packages](http://www.gisinternals.com/sdk/)
   section (e.g. selecting `release-1600-dev`).  Take note of where the
   `Makefile` is.

4. Unpack the SDK and edit `binding.gyp` to change the `ms_buildkit%` variable
   to point to SDK root path.

5. Download the MapServer source from the
   [GDAL and MapServer latest release versions](http://www.gisinternals.com/sdk/)
   section (e.g. selecting `release-1600-gdal-1-10-0-mapserver-6-2-1` and then
   `release-1600-gdal-1-10-0-mapserver-6-2-1-src.zip`).

6. Unpack the Mapserver source in the root of the SDK.  Edit `binding.gyp` to
   change the `ms_root%` variable to point to the Mapserver source root path.
   
7. Adapt the SDK `Makefile` to also point to your Mapserver source root
   directory (Search for `MS_DIR`).
  
8. Build Mapserver: in a MSVS console go in the SDK directory and type `nmake
   ms`.  Ensure the libraries listed in `binding.gyp` correspond to those just
   built and edit `binding.gyp` if this isn't the case.
   
9. Build Node Mapserv: from a console in the Node Mapserv root directory type
   `npm install .`

Note again that Windows is not supported so you will have to work through
issues yourself but feel free to discuss suggestions and improvements on
GitHub.
